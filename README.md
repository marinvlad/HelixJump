# HelixJump
Unity game inspired from HelixJump and HelixCrush.
It contains a reward system and levels procedurally generated at runtime.
All object management it's made using scriptable objects which are called at game awake, using a sequence system that intialize objects in a specific order so that all of their dependencies are allready in scene.

This is not a complete unity project.
